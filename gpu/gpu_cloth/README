This a small demo that calculates a 128x128 cloth simulation
entierely in the GPU.
Requires (at least) the following extensions:

    GLX_NV_float_buffer
    GL_ATI_texture_float
    GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object
    GL_NV_pixel_buffer_object
and of course support for GLSLang.

To compile just run "make", (it should work on really most linux distros),
and then run ./gpu_cloth
I am also providing a dynamic linux executable (that may not work).

I only tested it on a geforce 6, if you realize to make it work
on another card let me know.
It still uses pbuffers (and not fbo) because nvidia linux programmers
are too lazy to provide fbo enabled linux drivers (yet).
I also only tesed it on linux, but the source code should compile
on windows as well, if you realize to make it work let me know and
send me the windows exe, so that i can put it on the website.
Of course patches and suggestions are welcome (send me comments
at <monge@sns.it>)

I would lke to give special thanks to:
Alexander Zaprjagaev "Frustum", because I borrowed a lot of source
    code from his GPL project at <frustum.org>, even if i am sorry
    that he decided to stop writing opensource programs :-(
Emil Persson "Humus", who wrote a couple of cool cloth demos (in CPU)
    that gave me the idea for this demo.
